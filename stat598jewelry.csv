                            Amy Waltz Designs BlessingBands! These power phrase bangles are all completely hand-forged and in one way or another each member of our shop offers some role in their creation. They are hand engraved, hand hammered, hand soldered and a tremendous amount of love is poured into them. The tiny dangles and shapes are hand cut. They are hand aged with our eco-friendly darkening patina to bring out the characters and the fine details of the bands. Some are rolled for texture, some are flat, straight and traditionally hammered. They have depth, dimension, spirit and purpose. They are high quality and very durable and communicate a powerful message as you wear them. And we have sweet packaging dedicated just to our BlessingBands! Super perfect and absolutely ready for gifting!!★PLEASE NOTE★---------------------------------------------These are all priced individually! Add each BAND to cart one at a time. See pic 2 & 3 to pick your BlessingBand (see the list to the right of the stack of BANDS in pic 2 & 3 to see the name and number associated with each band - it will correspond in the drop down menu when you are ready to purchase) When you are ready to buy, refer to ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS below. For specific details on each band (metal, width, texture, dangles, shapes etc), see BLESSINGBAND DETAILS below. For tips on sizing your BAND, see SIZING DETAILS and TIPS FOR SIZING.Reach out to us if you have specific questions! We are here to help! :)★WHAT ARE BLESSINGBANDS?★---------------------------------------------BlessingBands are personal power bangles to give you strength, motivation, courage and wisdom throughout your day. Basically they are bangles with words and expressions to lift, inspire and bless you! They are meant to guide you toward consciously living. They are meant to help you awaken into your truth, your balance, your story. They are positive reminders to seek yourself; to empower yourself. I grew up knowing the importance of mantras through meditation. I find great value in meditation but it takes discipline. Meditation is bringing you to a place of acceptance and putting space in between thoughts so that you become calmer and more at peace. So BlessingBands are simply a tool to propagate a positive mind and give you a mantra on your wrist that awakens that truth. Jewelry is beautiful. We look at it and it makes us happy as we wear it but I want to take a further. I want it to help you achieve a greater inner calming; to bring you peace; to awaken your mind; to encourage you to live fully without reservation and with all your strength, power and purpose. And to be blessed, alive and awakened while you do it! xo Amy★ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS ★---------------------------------------------★FIRST★ (First drop down menu)Pick your BlessingBand(s). See pic 2 & 3 ... zoom in on it. See BLESSINGBAND DETAILS below for greater detail on each band. Again these are sold individually. You are not getting the entire stack. ★SECOND★ - Pick your FINISH & YOUR SIZE (Second drop down menu)Following are the two finishes we offer - POLISHED and CLEAR GUARD and below is the difference between them :)POLISHED - they will come straight out of the tumbler and get packaged up. But you should know that as these pieces come in contact with your skin, they will naturally age or darken, adding a rustic beautiful flare to them. If that isn't preferential to you, consider adding a temporary protective clear guard or purchase a polish cloth to keep them bright and sparkly: https://www.etsy.com/listing/113672883/beautiful-and-safe-polishing-cloth-toCLEAR GUARD SATIN SPRAY - they will still be tumbled for hours but then they will receive a coating of our eco-friendly clear guard satin spray. This low VOC, environmentally friendly spray helps to guard against sun, salts, heat, water and tarnish. Though it won't last forever, it will still give a beautiful satin coating and help to stave off the aging effect if you are not partial to that.★SIZING DETAILS★---------------------------------------------Extra Small/Small: 2.25"" Diameter OR 7"" CircumferenceMedium: 2.50"" Diameter OR 7.5"" CircumferenceLarge: 2.75"" Diameter OR 8.25"" CircumferenceXLarge: 3"" Diameter OR 9"" Circumference★TIPS FOR SIZING★---------------------------------------------With bangles the tricky part is actually not the wrist but the largest part of the hand that the bangle needs to pass over. A good way to figure out your size is to grab a flexible tape measure (most sewing kits have them) and squish your hand down (as if you're preparing to pass a bangle over it) take the flexible tape and wrap it around that part, the biggest part, of your hand and measure it very tightly. Then compare that measurement to the sizing above and select the bangle that works best for you. For me I'd rather work a bit to get a bangle on than risk it falling off. For me my measurement doing the steps above is 7.75"" and I take a medium bangle or 7.5"" in circumference. Keep that in mind when sizing yourself. Also, if you are buying for someone else and it's a gift, the most common size is medium. If you're unsure it's always best to go bigger than smaller. If you miss-size your bangle, please take a read in our policy section on returning a personalized product for a different size. It's much easier for us to size your bangle down than up. There is a cost associated with returning your piece to be resized so best bet is to measure and know for sure the size needed. Also, we cannot be held responsible for miss-sized bangles. We do provide these steps above but they are merely tips for sizing. The final size will have to come down to you.★METAL DETAILS★------------------------------------These beautifully handmade BlessingBands are made from the following metals: German Silver, Nu Gold and Copper. Do read about the metal content in our products please see our policies section for a breakdown of what's in all of our metals.★BLESSINGBAND DETAILS★---------------------------------------------See PIC 2 & 3 - the numbers correspond to the drop down menu.1 - *my faith is bigger than my fear* + TRUST ring.

In order to extend the life of your plated pieces, remove jewelry when sleeping, exercising, or doing other physically strenuous activities, as prolonged contact with sweat will cause the plating to wear away faster. In addition, avoid contact with perfumes, body oils, and other chemicals, including household cleaners. Never use chemical jewelry cleaners as these will wear away at the plating and do more harm than good. For light cleaning, gently polish with a soft, lint-free cloth in order to avoid scratching. Store in a cool dry place.….For more information:Please visit our shop at: www.etsy.com/shop/MignonandMignon/Our shop policies can be found here.https://www.etsy.com/shop/MignonandMignon/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav

                            I sold an Anatomical Heart necklace to a nurse a while ago.  She told me she was going to use it as a reference to the real thing.  Or for cheating in her Anatomy exams.  Sweet.  My Anatomical Heart is undoubtedly one of the most detailed and anatomically correct hearts you'll find.  Now available in White Bronze with a thick Silver plate finish. Just like the original bronze version that is also in my shop, this heart is perfect in every anatomical detail - if it's the real thing you're looking for you may well just have found it. Beautifully weighted, the heart looks great from every angle, and hangs off a jump-ring which is itself looped through one of the heart's arteries. Any more real, this thing would be pumpin'.This piece took a ridiculously long time to get right, but I'm really happy with the way it turned out. It looked great in the original bronze, and now looks stellar in it's new silver finery too. This piece is a real treasure and a true Lost Apostle original, and it'll rock out on the dudes and the chicitas with a vivacity loud enough to make a grown man weep. Yours for the taking.The heart is 25mm long (not including the jump ring) and about 14mm at its widest point.I've hung this heart on a 32"" gunmetal black chain.  For those of you rocking a darker vibe.★ Here's the Anatomical Heart in solid bronze - http://www.etsy.com/listing/70144056/anatomical-heart-necklace-bronze-heartand it's also available on leather too.Click here to have a look at all our other Anatomical Heart and Skull pendants -www.etsy.com/shop/LostApostle?section_id=8028308And click here to have a look through our shop -www.etsy.com/shop/lostapostle★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Don't forget to click the little heart over there if you like this item so you can find it again!

I gave it to my best friend as a present and she LOVED it! :) I thought the quality was really great too! It seems like it will last a very long time!! Thanks!""The tree of life reminds us of unity and living in peace.The Tree of Life is an important symbol in nearly every culture. With its branches reaching into the sky, and roots deep in the earth, it dwells in three worlds- a link between heaven, the earth, and the underworld, uniting above and below. It is both a feminine symbol, bearing sustenance, and a masculine, visibly phallic symbol- another union.The pendant frame is wire wrapped using 16 gauge copper wire. The tree is wire wrapped using silver plated wire with a copper core. Once the frame was hand formed I then hammered the frame for strength. I then wire wrapped the tree roots, tree limbs and formed the tree trunk. I  added stone chips for the tree leaves. The Tree of Life pendant was then added to a hand twisted black silk cord  with lobster closure.

Keeping in mind that everything is hand made so certain things may not be ""identical"".---Argentium Sterling Silver---Argentium Sterling silver is a modern sterling silver alloy which modifies the traditional alloy (92.5% silver + 7.5% copper) by replacing some of the copper with the metalloid germanium. As it retains the 92.5% silver content of the traditional alloy, it is still referred to as sterling silver.Argentium’s unique formulation enhances the appearance of the silver, giving an incredible natural brightness and lustrous beauty that outshines white gold, platinum and even traditional sterling silver.Finished jewellery made in Argentium is harder, stronger and more durable than traditional sterling silver. This means that Argentium silver articles are more resistant to damage from scratches, denting and deformation - this is particularly beneficial for jewellery items that are regularly worn.*All of our silver is Nickle Free*

                            These earrings were inspired by those worn by the title character of the upcoming Miraculous Ladybug.  Perfect for cosplay, or for anyone who loves cute ladybugs!   The studs are made of coral cabochons that have been bonded to silver posts; the black ladybug design is hand painted and sealed with a shiny acrylic top coat for maximum durability.  The cabochons measure about 8mm across.  The posts are made of silver-finished brass.  Each pair of earrings comes with a pair of soft rubber earnuts.  These feel light and comfortable even after extended wear! As with most pieces of jewelry, for best care, try not to wear the earrings in the shower or bath, or go swimming with them.

To this day it remains one of her absolute favorite designs :)The oval shaped charm is a one-sided and comes with a sterling silver bail or a 4 mm jump ring, so it can be worn on your favorite necklace, a simple chain, or attached to a charm bracelet. - Dimensions: 16mm long, 12mm wide - Also available with Cable Link Chain or Box Chain; Chains are solid 925 sterling silver, with spring-ring clasp.-------------------------------------The matching pendant is here:http://www.etsy.com/listing/56833763/raven-and-triple-moon-pendant-sterling-  Each charm comes in it's own little velvet pouch.

                            Verse 3 jewelry is designed to speak words of affirmation and love. Each piece is meant to inspire the wearer by pairing quotes and words of encouragement with a thoughtfully selected stone, pendant or bead. Each bracelet is adjustable and has sterling silver beads on the ends to help with tightening and loosening. Though designed to be understated and minimalistic, these bracelets are sure to stand out.Item Specifics:This is an adjustable bracelet with sterling silver findings on a durable nylon fiber cord. You can loosen the bracelet by pulling on the adjusting ""smart bead"" and tighten it by simply pulling on the two end beads. The smart bead is sterling silver and lined with a unique material that grips the cord fibers holding it in place once adjusted on the wearers wrist.  This material, however, also allows the bead to glide smoothly over the cord for easy adjusting. These eye-catching beads were hand painted and hand made in Peru. They make great friendship bracelets for two people or for a group of friends! My current batch of beads has five different color stories shown in picture 3 of the listing. If you'd like a specific color for your bracelet please let me know your preference in ""notes to seller"" at checkout. All items come with a Verse 3 gift box and will be shipped with care. The jewelry card reads:*****************************************************TRIBE“when you find people who not only tolerate your quirks but celebrate them with loud cries of “me too!” be sure to cherish them. because those weirdos are your tribe.” ******************************************************ALL BRACELETS ARE ADJUSTABLE TO ACCOMMODATE AN AVERAGE WOMANS WRIST. IF YOU ARE PURCHASING AN ITEM FOR ANOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC (MEN, CHILDREN, TEENS) SIMPLY CONVEY THAT INFORMATION IN ""NOTES TO SELLER"" AT CHECKOUT. THANK YOU:)*PLEASE NOTE:If ordering a necklace with a gemstone or hand made bead please note that you may not receive the exact item pictured but a stone/ bead similar. Each item is truly unique and holds its own beautiful characteristics. Many of the raw gemstones do, however, slightly vary in shape and color and may contain imperfections and inclusions. After all, they are cut from naturally occurring crystals and are, therefore, each wonderfully unique.

The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proven that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to medicine. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Amber is light weight and comfortable to wear.Amber Baby LLC photography by Colette at driftlightandco.com. Contact her for any Etsy shop photography needs.

I only use eco-friendly epoxy resin which is durable and long-lasting material. Proper cleaning and maintenance is essential to the longevity of your ring.  It normally shows no signs of wear/tear if treated properly.  I offer a high quality product that will last several years. However, certain rings (especially once with a thin band) are fragile and need to be treated with care. A ring can crack if knocked against a hard surface. The surface of a ring is highly polished and may be scratched if in contact with abrasives. Using abrasive cleaners or scrubbing pads will dull the surface of the ring.  It is recommended to take off a ring while washing your hands and avoid contact with products containing alcohol and /or chemicals (including hand sanitizers). Finally keep your ring away from direct sunlight to maintain its original color.Getting the Correct Ring Finger SizeResin rings are a little bit wider and don't slide easily onto the finger as the other thin metal rings. For a comfort fit, I recommend to order about half to one full size larger if you are stacking several rings together.

                            >>>This listing is for ONE Ring<<< If you want several, you'll need to add them to cart individually.See ★ORDERING DETAILS ★ below prior to purchase for easy ordering instructions.The heart ring does not come with hand personalization. We can do it, but you'll need to convo us first so we can tell you the price.With the exception of the heart ring, personalize your ring with a 7-character name or a word to inspire!!  This makes the perfect gift or gift to self! The word serves as a love note to carry with you always. Convo us if you wish to personalize your ring with more characters or with dates or additional words! If you want more than one ring, add them individually to cart to create your own unique stack! NEW UPGRADE!!! >>> Now you pick the FONT. See pic 5 and Ordering Details below for specifics.Order your 1/8"" wide, flat hammered 10 GA personalized ring in either BRUSHED base metal or POLISHED fine metal. The fine metal rings are made out of Recycled Sterling Silver (SS), Gold Filled or Rose Gold Filled.The base metal rings are made out of German silver (GS), Red Brass or Copper.If you order in base metal, the rings will be BRUSHED. If you order in fine metal the rings will be POLISHED. ★NOTE - the HEART RING is offered in base metal, German silver (GS), with a copper heart or fine metal, Recycled Sterling Silver (SS), with a copper heart. If you want it in other metals with other colored hearts, we can do that, too! Simply convo us for creating your own lovely DIY treasure!Rings pictured in brushed base metal. Fine metal will be polished  and more subdued in color hue.The rings in the first picture are as follows:*valerie* is on brushed copperthe heart ring is brushed german silver (GS) and copper*michael* is on brushed brassfont: tiny dancer★PLEASE NOTE★>>>This listing is for ONE Ring<<< If you want several, you'll need to add them to cart individually.Base metal rings offer a great cost savings to fine metal but some things should be noted. Please read details below under ★metals & sealants★ to be sure base metal is the way to go for you. Base metal has been shown to discolor skin in some people and base metal tends to age (tarnish) more rapidly than fine metal. We here at AWD love base metal. As it ages the hammer strokes become more visible and the piece becomes more rustic.If this is at all a concern to you, you may want to consider the fine metal upgrade. ★ORDERING DETAILS ★1. Add each ring to cart ONE AT A TIME. In the first drop down menu select the type of metal and the font (see pic 5).In the second drop down menu select the size (see below for sizing this stack). Then add to cart.You will do this for each ring, adding each individually to cart. 2. When you have added all the rings you want, add your customization (please keep characters to under 7 - if you need more convo me prior to purchase) in the comments portion of the order ... so here's an example:Ring #1 - Copper - Name to engrave - Amy - FONT = typewriterRing #2 - German Silver - Name to engrave - Joey - FONT = STANDARDRing #3 - Brass - Name to engrave - Jess - FONT = tiny dancerEtc Etc★NOTE - the HEART RING is offered in base metal, German silver (GS), with a copper heart or fine metal, Recycled Sterling Silver (SS), with a copper heart. If you want to personalize the heart ring we can do that, but you'll need to convo us first.★SIZING DETAILS★If you plan to stack up more than 3 we do suggest upsizing from your normal, narrow width sizing. What we mean by that is each ring is made true to US Ring Standards but when they stack up they turn into a wide banded ring. We find that most people benefit from upsizing for wide banded rings which requires going up 1/2 - a full size from your normal ring size for the most comfortable fit. The more you stack up, the more sizing up benefits most of our customers. Please note, however, that the size needs to be your call. We cannot be held responsible for miss-sized rings. If you do find you ordered the wrong size, there will be fees to resize to fit properly. Our recommendations on upsizing on are only that, recommendations. Best bet is to note that each ring measures 1/8"" wide. Depending on how many you order, you'll want to add them up. So if you order 3 rings, it will stack up to around 3/8"" wide. Then go to a jeweler and get sized for a ring that is that wide. That's the best way to ensure proper fit.★ IMPORTANT SHIPPING & PRODUCTION DETAILS!! ★**All of our pieces are made-to-order from scratch. **NORMAL PRODUCTION - Once we receive your order, it goes immediately into the normal production queue which is on average 5 business days but can be longer depending on our load.

                            COBRA is a ring inspired by the Egyptian goddess Wadjet.I have been drawn since childhood to ancient Egypt. With its immensely powerful pharaohs and a pantheon of fascinatingly named hybrid gods, this world represented for me a byword of mystery, esotericism, adventure and great treasures.The Cobra ring celebrates this passion and is part of a collection of Egytian jewelry dedicated to this theme. Wadjet, a patron goddess, was associated with the land and depicted as a snake-headed woman or an Egyptian cobra, a venomous snake common to the region.The ring is made of sterling silver, hand polished to a shiny finish and plated with a thick layer of 18k gold.The ring is available with yellow or rose gold plating.It is set with black zircons for the eyes, and a synthetic red ruby.We also offer the ring in sterling silver (as can be seen in the hand photos), and with a variety of other gemstones. Contact us for more details.HEIGHT of the Cobra - 26mm (1 inch)Band's WIDTH - 5mm (0.2 inch)The ring is custom-made to your ring size.The ring is sent beautifully gift-wrapped.Our standard shipping is with Registered Airmail with tracking code, a 2-3 weeks delivery service.We also offer express shipping with FedEx - a 2-5 day express, insured, door-to-door delivery service.----------------------------------------------------Our shops:http://www.aroshataglia.etsy.com - Fine Italian Silver Jewelryhttp://www.arosha.etsy.com - Engagement, Wedding and Gold, Fine Italian Jewelry----------------------------------------------------#G415

                            A bracelet designed to integrate your always needed hair tie elastic with stylish jewelry. The solution to dressing up the ugly hair tie on your wrist!- Stainless steel material available in silver finish- Fits wrists up to 6.75” in circumference- Bracelet comes with a black hair tie elastic and white jewelry box- Bracelet can accommodate both skinny and thick hair tie elastics Please check out our website: www.mariashireen.com for more styles and finishes!THE STORY:The bracelet started as a present designed and created by my husband (then boyfriend).  The ever-observant engineer that he is, noticed my habit (a basic necessity!) of wearing a hair elastic band around my wrist so that I could tie my hair back at work. The problem was the elastic band was an eye sore and it left a dent around my wrist. My husband decided to solve the problem, and did it with style! He created a bracelet that eliminates the pressure from the elastic around the wrist and makes the hair tie look like a stylish bracelet by creating a channel that holds the hair tie in place.  The idea was so simple, but so unique that he currently holds a US patent for the design!The bracelet was created to solve the common beauty etiquette dilemma, avoid getting the painful elastic band indention, and ensure your necessary hair accessory remains easily reachable.  The bracelet has not left my wrist since I got it, because I have a functional need for it!   We have made them for all our friends, family and others through word of mouth who all wear the bracelet everyday.  It has grown so popular that we decided to make more bracelets for purchase so that you too can wear your hair elastic with ease and style!INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMSPlease note if you reside outside of the United States you may be responsible for a customs charge from your country.  The price you pay on Etsy covers the bracelet, packaging, and postage fees.  It does not cover customs that your country may add and BitterSweet bracelet will not reimburse you for these charges.

These metals are not only essential nutrients in the diet (which can be absorbed through the skin), they also have electromagnetic properties that are known to have a positive effect on living tissue. Depending on your skin type and the amount of moisture from sweat and lotions present, copper and brass may turn your skin a greenish color. This is not harmful and will easily wash off. This bracelet is sealed to prolong this skin discoloration and tarnish. All metal sealants will eventually break down and need to be re-applied over time. Clear fingernail polish works as a sealant. - - - - - - Caring for Copper and Brass Jewelry - - - - - Copper and brass jewelry will tarnish over time, darkening in color. If you would like to remove this tarnish, first try a soft polishing cloth. For raw copper and brass pieces without a patina or sealant, you can soak your piece in a solution of white vinegar and water (1:1 ratio). This should not remove darkened letters and symbols on my stamped pieces, but WILL remove the patina and oxidation from my antiqued copper and brass pieces, and will break down the sealant if your piece has been sealed. To keep your pieces from tarnishing quickly, store in airtight baggies and clean your pieces regularly with a soft polishing cloth. For copper and brass pieces with a patina and/or sealant, only use a soft polishing cloth. Sealant will wear down over time. You may choose to re-apply your own, or you can ship back to me and I will clean and re-seal. Contact me for this option.For darkened letters, numbers, and symbols that have begun to wear down, contact me and I will walk you through an easy way to darken them back up using common household items!

Each letter will probably not be straight or even or the same depth as the other letters.

                            What could be more exciting than owning jewellery that contains a genuine piece of space debris?!This is a stunning  solid silver star meteorite pendant.It is handmade from pure silver and set with a fragment of Campo Del Cielo iron meteorite.The Campo Del Cielo fall is a famous Octahedrite iron meteorite that fell in large amounts in Argentina between 4000-5000 years ago.The star measures 1.5cm across and it is strung from an 18 inch sterling silver curb chain.Boxed and Labelled and complete with a signed certificate of authenticity.The certificate has a sophisticated holographic serial number and I can guarantee the authenticity of every meteorite item.NB - This piece is made to order so the one you receive won't be exactly like the one in the picture. VERY similar but not identical. These are all handmade pieces of jewellery and there are always slight differences.I have supplied countless fossils and meteorites to buyers in pretty much every continent on Earth.We have also sent specimens to museums and galleries – from the prestigious Science Museum in London to NASA’S Kennedy Space Center.These have been used by the educators there – and I’m sure they will have been seen and handled by thousands of visitors.

                            Gorgeous, rose gold colored druzy quartz stones are bezel set in NEW rose gold vermeil ear posts with backs. Natural, druzy stones are coated with titanium to bring out a consistent, brilliant rose gold color. Each stud is a tiny 6mm round and sparkles like a diamond. 18K rose gold vermeil bezel setting is polished to a high shine for a beautiful contrast in tone and texture. They are nickel free and suitable for sensitive ears. The rose gold is so soft and feminine, and universally flattering. A wonderful sparkly alternative to everyday studs!** Tiny druzy studs are a BEST SELLER in my shop - I also carry them with blue, black, plum, peacock, gold and rose gold druzy stones in rose gold vermeil, yellow gold vermeil and sterling silver settings.

Arrives thoughtfully packaged in a hand stamped eco-friendly kraft box wrapped with ribbon, ready for gift giving or treasuring for yourself. Also includes care instructions and storage bag to keep your item looking beautiful.A NOTE ABOUT DRUZY: Druzy is a coating of fine crystals that form on a rock fracture surface and produce the appearance of sugar or glittering stardust, depending on the size of the crystals. It is a naturally occurring gemstone, and as such, each will vary in shape, size and color with beautiful natural imperfections. Even within one pair of earrings, no two stones are the same. Each is truly unique and one of a kind!***********************************************Click here to enter my shop:https://www.etsy.com/shop/julianneblumloPlease read shop policies for the fine print...thanks for browsing!

                            Green aventurine is a comforter and heart healer. It brings well-being and emotional calm.  Like all aventurine, it is a stone of prosperity and good fortune. It promotes compassion and empathy, while reinforcing leadership qualities like decisiveness.  I have one of each size listed available for immediate shipping. But if your size isn't listed select custom size and i can make it to order. Rings may take up to 2 weeks to be shipped. Electroforming is the process of building up copper deposits on any object. The process can be very slow and it almost has a mind of its own. Sometimes there are striations in the copper, sometimes pits, sometimes there are little copper spheres. The results are always beautiful and unexpected making each piece entirely unique. Each piece had been cleaned up by hand and finished in the tumbler. The copper is absolutely raw... no added chemicals or sealants. Each stone and ring is unique, just like you are. And your ring will come in a little box with the stone's properties included.  ****See other electroformed rings here:https://www.etsy.com/shop/DrishtiHandmade/search?search_query=electroform+rings&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_searchA portion of the proceeds from every Drishti Handmade purchase is donated to charity. To see who we are donating to this month, check out the Drishti Handmade Facebook or Instagram page. How to care for your electroformed jewelry:To maintain the finish as long as possible, avoid prolonged exposure to water as well as harsh chemicals. The copper will oxidize and darken over time giving it a warm deep finish. This is natural and every oxidation is unique to the person who wears it and the environment in which they live. The copper grows with you. You can bring back the original sheen by gently rubbing it with a soft polish cloth. Greening may happen. It doesn't happen to everyone. I leave the metals raw to avoid causing any reactions to additional chemicals, but if you prefer the metal can be sealed with an aftermarket sealant or renaissance wax.
