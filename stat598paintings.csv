It symbolizes power, strength, and victory. The head of the gazelle that is in front of you possesses impressive and powerful horns in cool, calming colors in shades of purple and blue, horns that begin delicately and become increasingly more intense in color and intensity, and impressive, sharp eyes that emphasize the unique appearance of this animal. The head of the gazelle looks like some type of sculpture because of its thick layers of paint, and for this reason, in appropriate lighting, its face radiates power combined with elegance that create for him the perfect appearance. Completing the painting is black, elegant, and beautiful black spray that balances the colorfulness of the painting, creates beautiful opposition on the white canvas, and adds to the painting an abstract, uncontrolled, and undefined dimension that completes the modern look of this noble creature.DETAILS* Name: The Power of the Stag* Painter: Koby Feldmos* Size: 60"" 30"" (150 X 75 cm)* Original handmade oil painting on canvas* Shipping ""ready to hang"" (stretched) in rigid box* Style: Modern, contemporary* Certification of Authenticity attached * Express shipping 3-4 days worldwide* 30 Days full money refund accepted THIS PAINTING IS SOLDYour painting will be created very similar in same style, color and size.

I am proud to say all my paintings are Made in America, in my studio in New York each one is hand signed by me the artist.They are painted on high quality 3/4 inch stretched canvas with a Gallery wrapped edge. What is STRETCHED canvas ? Stretched canvas means the canvas has been stretched and secured on a wooden frame. GALLERY WRAPPED simply means the canvas has been secured and stapled on the back to give the canvas a nice finished edge. This is a great thing since you will not have to buy a frame for your painting, it can be hung up straight from the box.What will your piece look like when you take it from the box. It will be carefully wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure its safe arrival . Did I mention that all of my pieces are fully insured so there are no shipping worries. Ok back to the painting, once you remove the bubble wrap first thing you will notice is the beautiful protective finish. I want your piece to last for years and years, it also makes it easy to dust. You will see how this finish adds to the beauty of your painting, how the sheen plays off all the texture and movement this piece is made up of. Now if you look closer, you will see how all the colors are blended to create a rich marriage of light and dark  and how well they work together how the light will make the dark pop giving it interest from every angle. It will be love at first sight .Take a look to the bottom right hand corner here you will see my signature. I sign all my pieces along with the year I created them . On occasion a piece may only be signed on the back . You wonder why ? I do this because I like to leave my clients options. The versatility of hanging your piece vertical or horizontal .This way it can be easily displayed in different areas of your home.Alright now that you took your treasure from the box what do you do with it ? Its simple nothing special is needed just a couple little picture hangers and you are all set. Generally a painting can be hung up within 5 minutes. You might ask why I don't use wire on my pieces its plain and simple  over the years I have seen those little wires and hooks create damage. Damage that I'm not willing to risk on your painting. It also will leave you that hanging versatility I mentioned above.I think I have covered everything  but in case I didn't I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions send them along want to share your space, ask for a suggestion, I would be happy to see your room. Send me a photo I am always glad to help.This is my favorite part I'm going to ask a favor of you, if you would like to you to share a photo with me, of the painting hanging in your beautiful home. I would love to see it .This is one of my biggest enjoyments !!

                            Original large abstract canvas painting by JMJartstudio. This wall art measures 18 x 36 inches , Great black and white piece.featuring a sexy red umbrella.Please note this is a CUSTOM piece and will take  one week for completion.This is a original Customs piece, I would consider each one of my paintings to be one of a kind . Since it is painted by me each piece I create is different and unique in its own way .I am proud to say all my paintings are Made in America, in my studio in New York each one is hand signed by me the artist.They are painted on high quality 3/4 inch stretched canvas with a Gallery wrapped edge. What is STRETCHED canvas ? Stretched canvas means the canvas has been stretched and secured on a wooden frame. GALLERY WRAPPED simply means the canvas has been secured and stapled on the back to give the canvas a nice finished edge.This is a great thing since you will not have to buy a frame for your painting, it can be hung up straight from the box.What will your piece look like when you take it from the box. It will be carefully wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure its safe arrival . Did I mention that all of my pieces are fully insured so there are no shipping worries.OK back to the painting, once you remove the bubble wrap,first thing you will notice is the beautiful protective finish. I want your piece to last for years and years, it also makes it easy to dust. You will see how this finish adds to the beauty of your painting. Now if you look closer, you will see how all the colors are blended, to create a rich marriage of light and dark, and how well they work together. This piece will brighten up any room sure to make you smile. .Take a look to the bottom right hand corner here you will see my signature. I sign all my pieces along with the year I created them .On occasion a piece may only be signed on the back . You wonder why ? I do this because I like to leave my clients options.the versatility of hanging your piece vertical or horizontal .This way it can be easily displayed in different areas of your home.Alright now that you took your treasure from the box what do you do with it ? Its simple, nothing special is needed, just a couple little picture hangers and you are all set.Generally a painting can be hung up within 5 minutes. You might ask why I don't use wire on my pieces ,its plain and simple , over the years I have seen those little wires and hooks create damage.Damage that I'm not willing to risk your painting. It also will leave you that hanging versatility I mentioned above.I think I have covered everything ,but in case I didn't I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions send them along, want to share your space, ask for a suggestion, I would be happy to see your room. Send me a photo I am always glad to help.This is my favorite part I'm going to ask a favor of you, if you would like to you to share a photo with me, of the painting hanging in your beautiful home.

                            Original large abstract canvas painting by JMJartstudio. This wall art measures 24 x 72 inches , it is a 4 piece painting. featuring shades of yellow, brown, gray, citron and red.This is a custom piece , it is painted to order. it will take up to 7 - 10 days for completion.My name is Sherri I found myself being inspired quite a bit by nature. This piece represents an apple tree to me. The green leaves , the red, apples , the white / gray center with a brown trunk. There are colors and inspiration all around us. I try to take the time to look at things differently more than what it is. More like what could it be. This is an original piece, I would consider each one of my paintings to be one of a kind . Since it is painted by me each piece I create is different and unique in its own way .I am proud to say all my paintings are Made in America, in my studio in New York each one is hand signed by me the artist."" If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples you and I will each still have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange ideas then we will both have two ideas "" George Bernard Shaw They are painted on high quality 3/4 inch stretched canvas with a Gallery wrapped edge. What is STRETCHED canvas ? Stretched canvas means the canvas has been stretched and secured on a wooden frame. GALLERY WRAPPED simply means the canvas has been secured and stapled on the back to give the canvas a nice finished edge.This is a great thing since you will not have to buy a frame for your painting, it can be hung up straight from the box.What will your piece look like when you take it from the box. It will be carefully wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure its safe arrival . Did I mention that all of my pieces are fully insured so there are no shipping worries.OK back to the painting, once you remove the bubble wrap,first thing you will notice is the beautiful protective finish. I want your piece to last for years and years, it also make it easy to dust. You will see how this finish adds to the beauty of your painting, how the sheen plays off all the texture this piece is made up of.Look at the dark wash this piece has over it .Allowing every single nook and cranny of the texture to come alive. Creating interest and depth from every angle. Once your painting is displayed home you will notice people will be drawn to it, they will want to touch it .Guess what its OK let them because your painting is as durable as it is beautiful . Now take a look to the bottom right hand corner here you will NOT see my signature. .On occasion a piece may only be signed on the back . You wonder why ? I do this because I like to leave my clients options.the versatility of hanging your piece vertical or horizontal .This way it can be easily displayed in different areas of your home.With this piece the options are endless you can hang it as is , in a square, vertical ,together or separate the ideas are never ending have fun with it.Alright now that you took your treasure from the box what do you do with it ? Its simple, nothing special is needed, just a couple little picture hangers and you are all set.Generally a painting can be hung up within 5 minutes. You might ask why I don't use wire on my pieces ,its plain and simple , over the years I have seen those little wires and hooks create damage.Damage that I'm not willing to risk your painting. It also will leave you that hanging versatility I mentioned above.I think I have covered everything ,but in case I didn't I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions send them along, want to share your space, ask for a suggestion, I would be happy to see your room. Send me a photo I am always glad to help.This is my favorite part I'm going to ask a favor of you, if you would like to you to share a photo with me, of the painting hanging in your beautiful home.

Your painting will be created very similar in the same style, color and size. After you order, I will start to create your painting.  Each painting is original and individual but my customers loving their painting is my number priority!  I dream of painting and then I paint my dream -Vincent van GoghAs an artist I paint by feeling until the painting is an expression of myself. I gather inspiration from the situations I experience and express them through my paintings. Each piece has a personal meaning to me. When I paint I feel like I am engrossed in a world where creativity takes precedence. Most of my pieces have textural quaIity created by different thicknesses and sheens of the materials that I mix together. I have been selling art for several years. I started my art career painting murals and portraits but have now transitioned into abstract canvas pieces where I feel the artistic freedom to portray who I truly am as an artist.

It will be similar or have the same 'feeling' as my original painting that you see above that has already been sold. It will be hand signed and dated by me, the artist, on the front. Title: ""Cottage Garden 3"" Size: 36""x36"" on UNSTRETCHED CANVASVery large paintings (larger than 30""x30"" or 24""x36"") on stretched canvas are very expensive to ship so I paint them on unstretched canvas. I will ship this painting to you rolled up in a heavy duty shipping tube. When you receive it, you will take it to a frame shop and have it stretched on 1.5"" deep wooden stretcher bars or framed. Depending on your area, it usually costs about $100 to do this. I always continue the painting about 3 inches on each side of the unstretched canvas so that the painting can be gallery wrapped and stapled on the back. I don't charge for the added 3"" painted on each side. The actual size of the un-stretched canvas is 42""x42"".After I have finished your painting I will send you a photo for your approval.I have sold over 2400 paintings in the last 14 years through galleries, commissions and online. My award winning art has been viewed in many juried exhibitions, galleries, blogs, TV shows, and in private/corporate collections internationally.Artwork is protected by copyright.

Your painting will be created very similar in the same style, color and size. After you order, I will start to create your painting.  Each painting is original and individual but my customers loving their painting is my number priority!  I dream of painting and then I paint my dream -Vincent van GoghAs an artist I paint by feeling until the painting is an expression of myself. I gather inspiration from the situations I experience and express them through my paintings. Each piece has a personal meaning to me. When I paint I feel like I am engrossed in a world where creativity takes precedence. Most of my pieces have textural quaIity created by different thicknesses and sheens of the materials that I mix together. I have been selling art for several years. I started my art career painting murals and portraits but have now transitioned into abstract canvas pieces where I feel the artistic freedom to portray who I truly am as an artist.

                            Made to Order or customize this look: This artwork is made entirely of upcycled wood scraps. Wooden rectangles were painted in greens, blues, grays, browns and cream. I used a paint technique that allows some transparency so that each wood piece is rich with variation due to the wood grain. These colors are very soothing and would enhance the atmosphere in any home. 24x48 plus handmade frame. Your made to order piece will be very similar to the example shown.  No two pieces are exactly alike...each is beautiful and unique in its own right.

Modern, unique & trendy!Unmounted (rolled) canvas prints are great alternative to framing. You can mount THE PRINT yourself on wood stretcher bars available in brico shops or have professionally stretched.  Also you can put in on a frame behind glass like a NORMAL Posters! They look fantastic as they are, because of their extra-fine quality archival cotton ""fabric like texture"" or hang as a tapestry. ♥ You can turn any of my design into canvas artwork! Browse my full design collection here: https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?ref=hdr_shop_menu♥ Select the size canvas you need from the drop menu (Dimensions).♥ I don't offer options for art on stretcher bars because canvas prints on stretcher bars are inclined to pucker and warp. I'm not willing to take that chance.♥ Canvas art prints sent to you flat, larger print are rolled in a protective mailing tube to reduce shipping costs which they are expensive for  mounted canvas. I let  2 inch blank sides for framing. I suggest 1 1/2 inches wood frame thick for mounting your canvas. It's nicer on the wall, and it's not expensive.WANT FAST SHIPPING?Please check my policies page for more details about shipping:https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav♥ Xpresspost Canada-2 business day ♥ Xpresspost US-3-4 business day (but Canada Post guaranteed 3 b.day)♥ Xpresspost Everywhere Else 4-5 business day- 8 business day Australia TO SEE MY OTHER ITEMS, PLEASE CLICK HERE:Yoga art printhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?section_id=18378361&ref=shopsection_leftnav_1Print setshttps://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?section_id=18378391&ref=shopsection_leftnav_2Animal art printhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?section_id=18375116&ref=shopsection_leftnav_3Celebrity art printhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?section_id=18378393&ref=shopsection_leftnav_4Watercolor illustrationhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?section_id=18375114&ref=shopsection_leftnav_5Wildnesshttps://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Unbreakabubble?section_id=18378545&ref=shopsection_leftnav_6♥ FOLLOW METo get inspiration and info on new products!-Facebook | Atelier Deslauriers-Unbreakabubble-Etsy-www.anikdeslauriers.com♥ COPYRIGHT: I retain all copyrights to my artwork.* Frame is not included.

Each painting is original and individual but my customers loving their painting is my number priority!  I dream of painting and then I paint my dream -Vincent van GoghAs an artist I paint by feeling until the painting is an expression of myself. I gather inspiration from the situations I experience and express them through my paintings. Each piece has a personal meaning to me. When I paint I feel like I am engrossed in a world where creativity takes precedence. Most of my pieces have textural quaIity created by different thicknesses and sheens of the materials that I mix together. I have been selling art for several years.

It seemed only natural to adopt it for pastoral counseling and learning programs promoting spiritual, creative and personal growth for people of all faiths and beliefs. A tree also bears seeds or fruits, which contain the essence of the tree, and this continuous regeneration is a potent symbol of immortality. It is the fruit of a tree that confers immortality in the Jewish creation story.The Tree of Life is a universal symbol found in many spiritual traditions. It symbolizes many things, including wisdom, protection, strength, bounty, beauty, and redemption. This tree is symbolic of the Creator as it sustains creation with its abundant fruit, protection and regeneration. The Tree also represents humans as we too develop roots, strengthen our trunk and branch out to a wider vision of life as we grow. The tree provides provide shelter. Tall and strong, it has deep roots. It reaches skyward. It loses its leaves and grows new ones …bears fruit …gives shelter. With nurture and care, it lives for generations.

Title: ""Last Chance 2"" Size: 36""x30"" on UNSTRETCHED CANVAS (Display either vertically or horizontally)Very large paintings (larger than 30""x30"" or 24""x36"") on stretched canvas are very expensive to ship so I paint them on unstretched canvas. I will ship this painting to you rolled up in a heavy duty shipping tube. When you receive it, you will take it to a frame shop and have it stretched on 1.5"" deep wooden stretcher bars or framed. Depending on your area, it usually costs about $100 to do this. I always continue the painting about 3 inches on each side of the unstretched canvas so that the painting can be gallery wrapped and stapled on the back. I don't charge for the added 3"" painted on each side. The actual size of the un-stretched canvas is 42""x36"".After I have finished your painting I will send you a photo for your approval.I have sold over 2400 paintings in the last 14 years through galleries, commissions and online.

I am offering my custom art works for almost half of what I normally charge my clients (this won’t last forever, so act fast ).Recommended Sizes11x14   12x12   12x16   16x16   16x20   20x24   24x24   24x30   30x30   30x40   36x48   Gallery wrapping  Your finished painting is stretched onto a solid wood frame with the canvas wrapped around the back and hanging hardware attached.  It arrives ready to enjoy and hang.$29+FramingI work very closely with my preferred framer that has framed 100’s of my paintings; his price and craftsmanship is hard to beat. Your local framer would charge you close to twice the amount.  Convo me if you’re interested in having your artwork framed.   $119+

                            Choose your favorite word, color and stain for a custom sign that speaks to you! This sign measures approximately 20 inches long by 5 inches wide.PLEASE READ ALL INFORMATION BELOW REGARDING OUR SIGNS.*************************************************************************Each sign is painted on quality wood. We use a rough cut cedar frame which we stain and distress for a more vintage look. We then finish each sign with a polyurethane top coat for long lasting protection.  Each sign is made carefully on real wood which has natural imperfections (nicks, wood knots, etc.) Every piece of wood takes the paint and stain process differently as well as each sign will have it's own distress pattern.  This is what makes each sign unique and one of a kind, so no two signs will be exactly alike.HANGING YOUR SIGN:Each sign hangs from the ledge of the back of the frame. We recommend using wall anchors and screws to hang your sign. No hardware is included.All designs and photos owned by The Artistic Word Studio, Copyright 2013-present. All Rights Reserved

But never stop painting on canvas. I try to recreate the beauty of the natural world through variety of color, texture and movement. The movement symbolizes an energy which happens when working with oil on canvas.

We use a rough cut cedar frame which we stain and distress for a more vintage look. We then finish each sign with a polyurethane top coat for long lasting protection.  Each sign is made carefully on real wood which has natural imperfections (nicks, wood knots, etc.) Every piece of wood takes the paint and stain process differently as well as each sign will have it's own distress pattern.  This is what makes each sign unique and one of a kind, so no two signs will be exactly alike.HANGING YOUR SIGN:Each sign hangs from the ledge of the back of the frame. We recommend using wall anchors and screws to hang your sign. No hardware is included.All designs and photos owned by The Artistic Word Studio, Copyright 2013-present. All Rights Reserved
